# MAC_Tracker

Project for tracking MAC-address using a ESP-32 and wireshark

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT [ebay link](https://www.ebay.com/itm/DOIT-Development-Board-WiFi-Bluetooth-Low-Consumption-Dual-Core-ESP-32-ESP-2018/173061599471?epid=843519115&hash=item284b4670ef:g:BxIAAOSww9xZC~gr)
* follow [this](http://dagrende.blogspot.nl/2017/01/how-to-use-doit-esp32-devkit.html) to get started with DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT
* install [ArduinoPcap](https://github.com/spacehuhn/ArduinoPcap) libary from [spacehuhn](https://github.com/spacehuhn)


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running
